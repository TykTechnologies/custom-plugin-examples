# Custom Gateway Plugins

This is a repository that contains examples of [Tyk Plugins](https://tyk.io/docs/plugins/).  A Plugin is a custom middleware that is injected into the API request lifecycle, which further complements the built-in Tyk functionality such as authentication & rate limiting.

Here's the [different phases you can inject plugins](https://tyk.io/docs/concepts/middleware-execution-order/) in the request lifecycle.  A [response plugin](https://tyk.io/docs/plugins/response-plugins/) is also possible.

## Virtual Endpoints

[Virtual Endpoints](https://tyk.io/docs/advanced-configuration/compose-apis/virtual-endpoints/) are slightly different, more of a FaaS / Lambda as opposed to a plugin, and thus are treated differently
